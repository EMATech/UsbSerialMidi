Yamaha/Roland/Korg Serial MIDI
==============================

Serial Port Settings
--------------------

The general settings for the serial port are:

- baud rate: 38400 bps
- 8 bits per byte
- 1 stop bit
- no parity
- CTS flow control: optional
- RTS flow control: device-dependent
- DTR/DSR/XON/XOFF flow control: off

All Yamaha and Roland devices I tested so far work just fine with CTS control enabled.
Yamaha devices do not need CTS/RTS flow control. The Yamaha driver disables CTS/RTS in general.
Some Roland devices require RTS flow control. The Roland driver generally enables the RTS line.
The Korg AG-001B cable has CTS and RTS connected with each other on the PC side. The Korg driver disables CTS/RTS.
CTS/RTS is not working on the Korg NS5R and trying to use a Yamaha/Roland cable with it causes Windows to freeze when opening the COM port.

     device     |  CTS  |  RTS
----------------+-------+-------
Yamaha MU128    |   O   |   O
Roland SC-55mkII|   O   |   O
Roland SC-88VL  |   O   |   O
Roland SC-88Pro |   O   |   !
Roland SC-8820  |   O   |   O
Korg NS5R       |   X   |   X

O = optional
! = required
X = broken / don't use


Serial protocol
---------------
The "protocol" is just the same raw MIDI data that is usually transferred over MIDI cables.

However the serial protocol uses one special command, which is undefined according to the MIDI specification:

command F5 ##: select part group
	host -> device:
		- ## = 00 -> group A (default)
		- ## = 01 -> group A
		- ## = 02 -> group B
		- ## = 03 -> group C
		- ## = 04 -> group D
		Yes, values 00 and 01 are both going to the same group.
	device -> host:
		- Yamaha modules don't seem to use the F5 command for their outgoing data.
		- Roland SC-88Pro regularly outputs "F5 00".
		- Roland SC-8820 outputs "F5 05" for data forwarded from the MIDI In port.
		- Neither Roland nor Yamaha seem to indicate the difference between "MIDI Out" and "MIDI Through" data.

The Korg NS5R manual describes additional behaviour:
	host -> device:
		- F5 00 -> group assignment according to "MIDI ch To Port" settings on the device
		- F5 01 -> to MIDI Out
		- F5 02 -> group A
		- F5 03 -> group B
		- F5 F5 -> transmit F5 byte
		- F5 FF -> transmit FF byte
		- FF -> no operation

     device     |  F5 00  |  F5 01  |  F5 02  |  F5 03  |  F5 04  |  F5 05  |  F5 06  |  F5 07  
----------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
Yamaha MU128    | A + Out | A + Out | Part B  | Part C  | Part D  | ---     | ---     | ---     
Roland SC-55mkII| A + Out | A + Out | A + Out | A + Out | A + Out | A + Out | A + Out | A + Out 
Roland SC-88VL  | A + Out | A + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out 
Roland SC-88Pro | A + Out | A + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out | B + Out 
Roland SC-8820  | Part A  | Part A  | Part B  | ---     | ---     | MIDI Out| ---     | ---     
Korg NS5R       | dev-cfg | MIDI Out| Part A  | Part B  | dev-cfg | dev-cfg | dev-cfg | dev-cfg 

--- = following MIDI data is discarded
dev-cfg = Korg NS5R: per-channel routing according to "MIDI ch To Port" device settings


Detailed settings used by Serial MIDI drivers
=============================================

I disassembled the official Yamaha and Roland MIDI drivers and extracted the Serial port settings from them.

Drivers analyzed:
- YAMAHA CBX Driver v2.00 (Windows NT version)
- Roland Serial MIDI Driver v3.2 (Windows NT version)
- KORG PC I/F MIDI Driver for Windows NT v1.31


Yamaha Serial Settings
----------------------
from CBXT3USR.dll

DCB cState;
cState.DCBlength = 28;
cState.BaudRate = 38400;
//cState.flags = 0x0001;	// fBinary = 1; others = 0
	cState.fBinary = 1;
	cState.fParity = 0;
	cState.fOutxCtsFlow = 0;
	cState.fOutxDsrFlow = 0;
	cState.fDtrControl = 0;
	cState.fDsrSensitivity = 0;
	cState.fTXContinueOnXoff = 0;
	cState.fOutX = 0;
	cState.fInX = 0;
	cState.fErrorChar = 0;
	cState.fNull = 0;
	cState.fRtsControl = 0;
	cState.fAbortOnError = 0;
	cState.fDummy2 = 0;
cState.wReserved = 0;
cState.XonLim = 0;
cState.XoffLim = 0;
cState.ByteSize = 8;
cState.Parity = 0;	// NOPARITY
cState.StopBits = 0;	// 1 stop bit
cState.XonChar = 0;
cState.XoffChar = 0;
cState.ErrorChar = 0;
cState.EofChar = 0;
cState.EvtChar = 0;
cState.wReserved1 = 0;
commSetDCB(&cState);	// set stuff from registry
	cState.flags &= 0x8FF7;
	cState.XonLim = 0;
	cState.XoffLim = 512;
	cState.XonChar = 0;
	cState.XoffChar = 0;
	// then set variables from registry values:
	//cState.fOutxCtsFlow
	//cState.fRtsControl
	//cState.fAbortOnError
	//cState.XonLim
	//cState.XoffLim
	//cState.XonChar
	//cState.XoffChar
SetCommState(hFile; &cState);

Note: Even though the driver disables CTS/RTS flow control by default, the Yamaha MU128 works just with it enabled.


Roland Serial Settings
----------------------
from RDSMIDNT.EXE

Note: # = keep previous setting unchanged

DCB cState;
cState.DCBlength = 28;
cState.BaudRate = 38400;
	cState.fBinary = 1;
	cState.fParity = #;
	cState.fOutxCtsFlow = [0, 1];	// 1 when "CTS/RTS" option is on
	cState.fOutxDsrFlow = 0;
	cState.fDtrControl = 0;	// DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE
	cState.fDsrSensitivity = 0;
	cState.fTXContinueOnXoff = #;
	cState.fOutX = 0;
	cState.fInX = 0;
	cState.fErrorChar = #;
	cState.fNull = #;
	cState.fRtsControl = [1, 2];	// 2 when "CTS/RTS" option is on, 1 = RTS line always enabled, 2 = RTS handshake
	cState.fAbortOnError = #;
	cState.fDummy2 = #;
cState.wReserved = #;
cState.XonLim = #;
cState.XoffLim = #;
cState.ByteSize = 8;

cState.wReserved1 = #;

Roland modules that require RTS will stop accepting data after a short amount of time.
They are trying to send out MIDI "Active Sensing" messages (FE)
and when the transmit buffer is full, they will hang, waiting for the RTS line to be enabled.

CTS flow control isn't required, but all devices I tested kept working when enabling it.

RTS enable required:
- SC-55mkII: no
- SC-88VL: no
- SC-88Pro: yes
- SC-8820: no


Korg Serial Settings
--------------------
from KORGSMDN.DRV

The driver defines the DCB struct using
	BuildCommDCB("baud=38400 parity=N data=8 stop=1", &cState);

This results in:
cState.BaudRate = 38400;
	cState.fParity = 0;
	cState.fOutxCtsFlow = 0;
	cState.fOutxDsrFlow = 0;
	cState.fDtrControl = 0;
	cState.fDsrSensitivity = 0;
	cState.fTXContinueOnXoff = 0;
	cState.fOutX = 0;
	cState.fInX = 0;
	cState.fRtsControl = 0;
cState.ByteSize = 8;
cState.Parity = 0;	// NOPARITY
cState.StopBits = 0;	// 1 stop bit

The Korg NS5R doesn't support flow control.
